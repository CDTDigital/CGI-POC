# CORS settings
#   A list of comma-separated domains that the service will allow cross-origin access from.  If the Origin matches one
#     of the domains in the list the application will generate a matching Access-Control-Allow-Origin header in the response.
#     If the Origin header does not match, the application will not send the A-C-A-O header back to the client.
#   Uses Jetty's CrossOriginFilter, so partial regex is supported:
#     i.e. https?://*.cgi.[a-z]{3}   -> supports http/https with any subdomain and any 3 character top-level domain for the host "cgi"
#   c.f. https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/9.3.x/cross-origin-filter.html
# IMPORTANT NOTE: if there is no * character in the expression, the filter processes it as a raw string, NOT as a regex
